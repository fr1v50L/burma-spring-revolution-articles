# Burma Spring Revolution Articles - ဗမာ့နွေဦးတော်လှန်ရေးစာစဉ်

This is an archive for articles posted on We Resist - Burma, Catch the Hell Hound and BBP - Resistance pages on Facebook. This site is created so that people can still read the articles when the posts on Facebook or the pages itself got reported and taken down, which has sadly become periodic. This site is made by a regular reader of the articles from the abovementioned pages.

## How to add articles

Articles are stored in Markdown files in `posts` folder in respective sub-folders for the three pages.

Files are named with the date the post was published in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, followed by a three-word summary of article title (e.g - `word1-word2-word3`) all connected by hyphens.

YAML metadata of the markdown files are stored as follows:

```
---
title: [Article title]
author: [Author name, if exists, or page name]
date: [Month Day, Year] (e.g January 1, 2021)
---
```

If the above formats are satisfied, add the mardown file to respective folder and push the changes to this repository. The website is hosted on Netlify so once the changes are made, the site will be automatically built again and published.
